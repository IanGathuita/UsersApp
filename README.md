# UsersApp
This is a very basic app to demonstrate how SQLiteOpenHelper works in Android. It was pushed to github so that the beginer could examine the code from a remote location.
Being a beginer's guide, it is very simple and overlooks some considerations such as using a ConstraintLayout for the layout, using CursorLoaders to load data or
implementing a RecyclerView to display the list of users. Its main focus is on basic CRUD operations.
